Task: We have to calculate x ^ n.

Naive approach
--------------
We will run a loop n times and each time multiply res with the base to have the result.

Time complexity: O(N)


Better approach
---------------
if the exponent is odd we will multiply res with base, else multiply base with base and divide exp by 2.

Time complexity: O(logN)
