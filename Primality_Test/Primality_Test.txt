Naive Approach
--------------
We will run a loop from 2 to N - 1 and check if any of the numbers divides N or not?
If divides then N is not a prime. Else N is prime.

Time Complexity : O(N)



Better Approach
---------------
All divisors of N occurs in pairs of (a, b) such that a * b = N.
For example, 12 has following divisors pairs: (1, 12), (2, 6), (3, 4).
So, we will run a loop until sqrt(N) and check if any numbers divides N or not? If divides then N is not a prime. Else N is prime.

Time Complexity : O(sqrt(N))
