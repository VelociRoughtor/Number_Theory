If the question asks:
For Q queries, check if a number N is prime or not?
constraints: (1 <= Q <= 10^5), (1 <= N <= 10^6)

If we check for each number using Primality test (sqrt(N)) the time Complexity will be Q * sqrt(N), which won't pass the time constraints.

Better Approach
---------------
We have to precompute all the numbers until MAXN = 10^6 and store information whether it is prime or not in an array. Then find each number prime or not in O(1). 

Time Complexity: O(NloglogN)
