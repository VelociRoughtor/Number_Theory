Given a matrix A, and an integer we have to find A^n

Naive Approach
--------------
Lets take, res = A. We will run a loop to n and each time we multiply A with res to get the ultimate result.

Time complexity : O(A^3 * N)



Better Approach
---------------
We will do the multiplication process using binary exponentiation. This will make the- 

time complexity : O(A^3 * logN)
